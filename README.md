PowerSim is the main file and it contains the full analysis to output simulations (Sim_Result.csv file).

It takes ~4 days to run the whole script on a regular computer. <br>
Computer Specs: <br>
Processor	Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8565U CPU @ 1.80GHz   1.99 GHz <br>

It calls for the ContextFunctions.R, ContextFunctions_Ind.R, ItemFunctions.R, ItemFunctions_Ind.R files, so these dependencies should be in the same directory as the main file.
